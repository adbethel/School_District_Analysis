                        School District Analysis
  
  This student data file shows a summary of high school students and their descriptive characteristics. We were able to clean up the data, remove missing and duplicate values, and display a mean reading score of 72.4 and math score of 64.7. We can also see that, on average, Charter schools perform better in comparison to Public schools in mathematics. We could use this same data file to see how Charter schools measure up to Public schools in other academic subjects. This data file would be beneficial because it can display schools that fall below the average performance rates, and, more specifically, the areas like reading and math that they may be behind other schools in.
